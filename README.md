nds-bootstrap is an open-source application that allows Nintendo DS/DSi ROMs to be natively utilised rather than using an emulator. This works on Nintendo DSi/3DS SD cards through CFW and on Nintendo DS through flashcarts.

# ROM Compatibility

nds-bootstrap supports most DS ROMS, with a few exceptions. You can enhance your gaming experience with cheats and faster load times than general cartridges (for games that support those features). Game saving is supported too and will be saved in the `.sav` extention. If you find a bug, please report it in the [issues tab](https://github.com/ahezard/nds-bootstrap/issues).

Be sure to manually patch out the Anti-Piracy functions though, as nds-bootstrap does not include patches of this sort.

nds-bootstrap also supports many homebrew applications, including emulators such as lameboy and NesDS.

# Compiling

In order to compile this on your own, you will need [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) with the devkitARM toolchain, plus the necessary tools and libraries. DevkitPro includes `dkp-pacman` for easy installation of all components:

```
 $ dkp-pacman -Syu devkitARM general-tools dstools ndstool libnds libfat-nds
```

Once everything is downloaded and installed, `git clone` this repository, navigate to the folder, and run `make` to compile nds-bootstrap. If there is an error, let us know.

# Frontends

Since nds-bootstrap uses a .ini file to load the settings, a frontend isn't required. However, for ease of use, we recommend you use a frontend known as TWiLightMenu++. It's an open-source Nintendo DS, DSi, and 3DS home menu alternative made by RocketRobz that can also be used as a frontend for nds-bootstrap. It has a DSi theme, a 3DS theme, an R4 theme and an Acekard theme, as well as the ability to launch a large variety of ROMs including, NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, SEGA Master System, Game Gear, and Genesis, as well as Nintendo DS roms!
